# System-Programming-Final-Project
This project consists of 3 seperate parts: I) a web creator bash script which creates a requested number of simple websites, II) a web server which servers HTTP GET requests for those web pages and III) a webcrawler which, given a starting url, crawls for all the web pages he can find , saves them on a specified directory and then answers to search commands for words in those web sites.
